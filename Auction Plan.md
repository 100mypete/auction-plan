THE BEST AUCTION SYSTEM 100% NOT RIGGED AND TOTALLY FAIR

- auctions last a default of 24 hours
- each bid adds 1 hours to the clock
- any amount can be bid
- no max amount of bids
- no price cap


how to create auctions

- there will be a form of sorts to fill out when you want to auction something
- sorta like the process for uploading a youtube video (if you know what that's like)
- list the item and be able to monitor the auction
- special role allows you to set a minimum bid
  - probably unlocked by doing 3 successful auctions or something like that


User profiles

- can see what people have bid more in the past
- can see past and current listings
- auction winners give a rating to the lister based on how reliable they were in getting the item delivered
- low ratings = probably scam = don't bid unless you have big balls


special admin role

- can monitor auctions and remove any sus people
- can take down auctions
- can see all the people who have bid


the fun part (how to win)

upon expiration of time:
- highest bidder automatically loses all money
- everyone else who bid gets 50% of investment back
- 2nd highest bidder wins the item being auctioned and all the remaining money
  - first the worst, second the best
